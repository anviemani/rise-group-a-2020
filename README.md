# Decreased Calcium Concentration Leads to Hyperexcitability in Computational Network Model of the Dentate Gyrus

Welcome to our website! Our names are Sreeanvitha Emani, Thomas Lu, Sophia Ma, and Aarohi Nadkarni. Over the summer before our senior year, we were selected as 4 of 54 computational neurobiology students to participate in Boston University's Resarch in Science and Engineering (RISE) program as part of the Practicum track. For six weeks, we learned interdisciplinary topics in neuroscience and computer science. In addition, we conducted our own research project. Our study focuses on explaining the mechanisms behind hypocalcemia-induced seizures.
